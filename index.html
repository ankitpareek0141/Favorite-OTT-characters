                            Lucifer Morningstar, created as Samael
                            (Hebrew: סַמָּאֵל) and also known as the
                            Lightbringer, is the titular protagonist of
                            the TV Series, Lucifer. He is an Archangel
                            and the twin brother of fellow Archangel,
                            Michael. Following a failed rebellion
                            against his Father, Lucifer was banished
                            from Heaven and forced to oversee the
                            torture of damned Human souls for eons as
                            the Ruler of Hell. During his time as the
                            King of Hell, Lucifer tempted Eve in the
                            Garden of Eden, leading to Eve and her
                            husband Adam being banished to live on Earth
                            for the rest of their lives. After some
                            visits to Earth, He would reunite with his
                            old friend, Lilith in 1946 to help her find
                            her ring. Lucifer was ultimately gifted the
                            ring, along with Lilith's Immortality.
                            Widely known as the Devil or Satan by
                            Humans, Lucifer is blamed for the sins of
                            mankind.

                            character. He is primarily portrayed by Bob Odenkirk, and was created by Vince Gilligan and
                            Peter Gould.[3] The character is an Albuquerque-based lawyer who embraces his tendencies as

                            involved in the city's criminal underworld. Saul is an Irish American but pretends to be

                        <p class="card-text"> Sherlock depicts "consulting detective" Sherlock Holmes (Benedict Cumberbatch) solving various mysteries in modern-day London. 
                            Holmes is assisted by his flatmate and friend, Dr John Watson (Martin Freeman), who has returned from military service in Afghanistan with the Royal Army Medical Corps.
                            Although Metropolitan Police Service Detective Inspector Greg Lestrade (Rupert Graves) and others are suspicious of Holmes at first, over time, his exceptional intellect and bold powers of observation persuade them of his value.
                            In part through Watson's blog documenting their adventures, Holmes becomes a reluctant celebrity with the press reporting on his cases and eccentric personal life. 
                            Both ordinary people and the British government ask for his help.
                            Although the series depicts a variety of crimes and perpetrators, Holmes's conflict with his archenemy Jim Moriarty (Andrew Scott) is a recurring feature.
                            Molly Hooper (Louise Brealey), a pathologist at St. Bart's Hospital, occasionally assists Holmes in his cases.
                            Other recurring roles include Una Stubbs as Mrs Hudson, Holmes and Watson's landlady, and series co-creator Mark Gatiss as Holmes's elder brother Mycroft..</p>
