                            Manoj Bajpayee is a phenomenal actor but
                            thanks to the wide acceptance of the OTT
                            platforms, the Aligarh actor hit the
                            mainstream spotlight with The Family
                            Man, much like he did in his early days
                            with Satya. While he has appeared in
                            critically acclaimed films like Pinjar,
                            Gali Guleiyan and Gangs of Wasseypur,

                            others. With The Family Man, Bajpayee
                            led the cast from the front and since he
                            was present in more or less all the

                            Lucifer Morningstar, created as Samael
                            (Hebrew: סַמָּאֵל) and also known as the
                            Lightbringer, is the titular protagonist of
                            the TV Series, Lucifer. He is an Archangel
                            and the twin brother of fellow Archangel,
                            Michael. Following a failed rebellion
                            against his Father, Lucifer was banished
                            from Heaven and forced to oversee the
                            torture of damned Human souls for eons as
                            the Ruler of Hell. During his time as the
                            King of Hell, Lucifer tempted Eve in the
                            Garden of Eden, leading to Eve and her
                            husband Adam being banished to live on Earth
                            for the rest of their lives. After some
                            visits to Earth, He would reunite with his
                            old friend, Lilith in 1946 to help her find
                            her ring. Lucifer was ultimately gifted the
                            ring, along with Lilith's Immortality.
                            Widely known as the Devil or Satan by
                            Humans, Lucifer is blamed for the sins of
                            mankind.

                            Rhaenyra Targaryen, Princess of Dragonstone, following Ser Laenor Velaryon.

                            Daemon was the most experienced warrior of his time and wielded the Valyrian steel blade
                            Dark Sister. A dragonrider whose dragon was Caraxes, Daemon declared himself the King of the

                            of his wife, Rhaenyra. </p>

                            But despite his shortcomings he stays true to his comrades (nakama) without any care for his
